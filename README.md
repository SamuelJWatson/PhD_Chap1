# PhD_Chap1_HeatFlux
All things PhD for chapter 1 

This readme will be updated with details as a chapter direction is developed. 

## Fortnightly meetings
Supervisor meetings are currently scheduled fortnightly Tues 2pm in IMAS.332 (see outlook event).
Technical meetings are currently scheduled for the alternate fortnightly Tues 2pm in IMAS.332 (see outlook event).

A running issue of meeting outlines/notes is avaliable [here](https://github.com/SamuelJWatson/PhD_Chap1_HeatFlux/issues/1).

## How it works
All aspects of the chapter are tracked through [issues](https://github.com/SamuelJWatson/PhD_Chap1_HeatFlux/issues). Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task. To add a comment simple use the comment box at the bottom of the issue thread (you may have to scroll down). When an issue has reached a conclusion it will be closed and archived. 

The [Project/analysis Overview](https://github.com/SamuelJWatson/PhD_Chap1_HeatFlux/projects?query=is%3Aopen) lists all the analysis tasks (as detailed in the issues) and thier stages of completion. It is a good way to see which issues are the current focus.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly). If you need help with this please ask (Sam, Paul, ...) or a basic tutorial is avaliable [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world).
